1. create virtual environment in order not to globally install third-party or pip packages and modules.

2. use this command to install dependencies "pip install -r requirements.txt" into your Virtual env... as I have the dependencies freeze in requirements.txt file

3. Note that I use a .gitignore file to stop git from tracking my virtual environment as this is a good practice. 

4. use git bash if on windows to clone repository into your local machine.
